<blockquote>&mdash;&hairsp;Everything written symbols can say has already passed by. They are like tracks left by animals. That is why the masters of meditation refuse to accept that writings are final. The aim is to reach true being by means of those tracks, those letters, those signs&puncsp;—&puncsp;but reality itself is not a sign, and it leaves no tracks. It doesn’t come to us by way of letters or words. We can go toward it, by following those words and letters back to what they came from.

<blockquote>&mdash;&hairsp;But when we give up symbols and opinions, aren’t we left in the utter nothingness of being?</blockquote>
<blockquote>&mdash;&hairsp;Yes.</blockquote>
