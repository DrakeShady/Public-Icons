### Icon specification

#### Aesthetic 

1. Design the icons to be paired with a heavy sans-serif typeface. Eventually I want to produce the icon set in other weights
2. The icons should be blocked
3. Avoid outlines and thin lines 
4. Ensure the new icon matches the existing icons. Imagine the icon set as if it were a typeface.
5. Icons should be readable at 16x16
6. Make its shapes as simple as neccessary
7. Try and ensure the icons have an even weight
8. Prefer hard corners to soft
9. Prioritize icon comprehension over beauty
10. Don't put text in the icon
11. Don't incorporate anything not in the public domain into your icon

#### Technical

1. Outline all strokes before submitting
2. Ensure all icons are properly transparent. Fill:white is not transparent
3. By convention make icon artboards 120x120
4. Center icons inside artboard
